### Assignment Issues
I originally had all of the Javascript code in one main.js file, but some of the code was causing errors in other parts of the code. I couldn't diagnose the exact issue within that one file, so I separated the Javascript code so each page has its own Javascript file. The simple act of separating the code in this way resolved all of the errors. 

### Outside Sources
[CodePen - Read More/Read Less Button](https://codepen.io/shimaamohamed923/pen/yLyaLKv)
I used the "if" loop code from this site as a guide for implementing the read more/read less button. 

[Stack Overflow - Changing InnerHTML](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41147371/changing-innerhtml-based-on-input-value)
The API I used for showing the current day of the week displayed the day of the week as a number 0 - 6. This wasn't helpful on the front end, so I used this site to figure out how to convert a value to a string. By doing this, I could set the API number output to its corresponding day of the week.

[CodePen - Accordion](https://codepen.io/sureshrkm/pen/ZbzBpr)
I used this site to help structure the accordion.
